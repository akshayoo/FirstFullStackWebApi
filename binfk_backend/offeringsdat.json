Hybridomas may express multiple antibody transcripts, including aberrant or non-productive chains. This service combines targeted cDNA amplification with long-read next-generation sequencing to enable accurate recovery, annotation, and classification of functional antibody sequences. The workflow supports antibody cloning, expression, humanization, and intellectual property preservation by ensuring long-term retention of antibody sequence information independent of hybridoma cell line stability. Optional in silico pairing and gene synthesis services enable reconstruction of functional VH-VL antibody pairs for downstream applications.",
